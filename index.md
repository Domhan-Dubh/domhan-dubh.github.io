# Domhan Dubh

## The Meaning We Make

Domhan Dubh means "Black Earth" in Gaelic/Irish. It's not a comman phrase among Gaelic-speakers. It doesn't really mean anything to them. In this empty yet fertile soil of meaning, we hope to plant a seed and grow a tree or perhaps a forest of meaning so that one day, when someone says Domhan Dubh, it means there is great hope for the future of Humanity because we have a system of thought that an individual can apply to their decisions in life in order to create contentment, happiness, excitment, and a feeling of importance for themselves and those they interact with without feeling conceit, shame, or guilt about how it will hurt others.

In its current form, Domhan Dubh is essentially a Philosophy containing a [Glossary](https://domhan-dubh.github.io/Philosophy/Glossary) of terms that will help us see the world clearly for what it is and understand where change comes from and why and how we can use the infinite potential of this change to make a better future for ourselves, our loved-ones, and [Humanity](https://domhan-dubh.github.io/Philosophy/Glossary/Humanity).
